            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
            these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I
            am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
            created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
            friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
            existence, that I neglect my talents.

            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
            himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
            armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
            his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
            sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready
            to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with
            the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
            "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream.

            The European languages are members of the same family. Their
            separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe
            uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their
            grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone
            realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could
            refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be
            necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common
            words.

            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
            pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor
            again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
            of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
            circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
            great pleasure.
